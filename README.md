## Introduction ##
This is course project in the form of 4 -student group in MIS-612, Aligning Information Systems and Business Strategies. The professor shared the datasets in Drexel Co-op feedback questionnaires from 2014 to 2019 and asked us to select 3-4 questions to solve based on analyzing datasets. The group leader requested each of group member to solve one of the questions. Therefore, I decided to analyze what are Drexel Students' Strength. I used Python and Excel to output conclusions.
